# Master Thesis MAPF Solver

This repository contains the implementation of a Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) solver developed as part of my Master's thesis. The solver finds collision-free paths for multiple agents on a grid or map. 

## Description
The master thesis consisted in the implementation of different algorithms to solve efficiently MAPF problems. These problems consists of several agents reaching a goal, finding collision-free paths, and finding their goals in the most efficient way.

Inside Instructions.txt, there are steps on how to run the different algorithms, and their variants

## Levels
Under the folder levels, there are multiple and different levels, each of them with a different type of complexity, distrubution, number of agents, number of colors,... Levels files must have a specific format, as shown in the examples.
